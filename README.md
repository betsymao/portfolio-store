# OKAPI

OKAPI is an example e-commerce project.

## About the Project

The purpose of this project is to showcase clothing products from a third-party API on a website. The project's primary features include a home page, product pages, product detail pages, a cart system and a 404 page.

The project was built using the Fake Store API, React and Bootstrap.

## Developer Notes

I wanted to build this example project to demonstrate a responsive, clean and modern website design through the use of a simple colour palette, selection of an approrpiate font pairing and experimenting with spacing elements on the pages. The design/feel and features of the website were inspired by MNG, UNIQLO, SUPERDRY, MESHKI and H&M. 

The project also demonstrates my ability to:
* use the React library (building components, contexts)
* implement a CSS framework (Bootstrap)
* connect to and use a third-party API (Fake Store API) on my example project
